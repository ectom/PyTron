# Welcome to the Student Manager App

Do you run an academic institution of sorts? Do you need to manage the attendance of your students? Do you need to contact the parents when their child is ready for pickup? Well look no further. With the Student Manager, students can check in and check out with ease. You can keep track of when they arrive and when they finish up. Upon checkout, an email or text message will be sent to their guardian to let them know that their child needs to be picked up!
